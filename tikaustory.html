      <b>Tikau Emirate</b> is inhabited mostly by <b> Karai-Karai </b> people.
      Archeological and ethno-linguistic sources categorize the Karai-Karai as
      part of the Chadic group of languages who left Yemen and came through
      Egypt to settle on Mega-Chad shores searching for Agricultural, pastures
      and hunting lands. Oral tradition assigns the origin of Karai-Karai to a
      different account. It relates that, the Karai-Karai shifted west ward from
      Yemen in the Middle East along with the kanuri and other groups. The Kisri
      legend especially links this migration to the successive advents of the
      great monotheist religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some
      Karai-Karai splinter groups cover the eastern plains of present day Jigawa
      (Gwaram) and Bauchi (Shira) States. Others settle in the arable western
      plains of yobe state, around the 15th century and founded the various
      Karai-Karai clans of Tikau, Langawa, Degubi, Pakarau and Dazigau.
      According to a book titled languages of the world", in its entry on the
      tribe, Karai-Karai Language is described as Afro-Asiatic, Chadic Language
      with with the following dialects; <br />
      i. Jalalum (Western Karai-Karai)<br />
      ii. Pakaro (Northern Karai-Karai)<br />
      iii. Ngwajum (Eastern Karai-Karai)<br />
      However, in 1987 publication placed Karai-Karai tribe as the thirty-three
      (33rd) largest ethnic group in Nigeria, and the Largest ethnic group in
      southern yobe. A man called <b> Shikau founded Tikau dynasty </b>, other
      rulers reigned in succession notably,
      <b>Ndiirama Jiji and Ndiirama Mataata</b>. <b>Mataata</b> was confronted
      and defeated by the <b>first Borno Caliphate in 1958</b>. His successor
      <b>Warkati</b> was the first to adopt the Kanuri title <b> Mai </b>.On the
      strength of their cultural and economic commonality,
      <b> Langawa, Degubi, Pakarau and Dazigua </b> coalesced into virile
      Commonwealth under the leadership of
      <b> Mai Saaban (1873 – 1923) of Tikau </b>. <b>Saaban’s</b> expansion of
      the Tikau frontiers was only halted by the arrival of the british Colonial
      forces at the dawn of the 20th century.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reign of Saaban’s son,<b> Mai Grema (1924 – 1945) </b>, Tikau
      was included in the new Fika Emirate. So too were other chieftaincies
      within the defunct Karai-Karai Commonwealth. Tikau continued to remain as
      chiefdom, its first Western Educated chief, the son of Mai Grema,<b>
        Alhaji Abubakar Shuwa Ibn Grema
      </b>
      was elevated to the status of a District Head in 1962. His appointment as
      a district head partially restored shikau’s pre-colonial portion of land
      separated from Tikau by the British.
      <b>Alhaji Abubakar Shuwa, the 10th ruler of Tikau</b>, succeeded his
      father Mai Grema from 1945. He reigned as village head of Tikau up to
      1962. when he was appointed District of Nangere. He was elevated to the
      status of Emir of Tikau in 1993; however this was short lived as the
      emirate was soon dissolved. The Emirate was re-instated in 2001 and the
      Mai of Tikau was re-appointed and elevated to the status of second class.
      He died on Tuesday , 17th July, 2001, and his son
      <b> Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema, the 11th ruler of Tikau </b>
      succeeded him as
      <b
        >Mai of Tikau on 21st july, 2001 and was turbaned on Saturday 11th may,
        2002.</b
      >
      <br />
      <b
        >Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema was upgraded to first class Emir on
        28th may, 2007 by Alhaji Bukar Abba Ibrahim, FNIQS, the then Governor of
        Yobe state.</b
      >
      On 5th August 2010, Alhaji Muhammadu Abubakar Ibn Grema was appointed the
      first Chancellor of Yobe State University, Damaturu, by Alhaji Ibrahim
      Gaidam, FCNA, FCPA, Executive Governor of Yobe State.

      either between different tribes such as Farmers - herdsmen crisis; or

      inheritance. The Emrate council plays a remarkable role in settling such
      disputes within its threshold. Culturally, the people of Tikau Emirate
