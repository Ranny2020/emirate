            Mai Saaban, who ruled from 1887 to 1921 CE. it was during his reign
            that Tikau dynasty attained it greatness and experienced mass
            territorial expansion which was only halted by the arrival of the
            British Colonial forces at the dawn of the 20th century. Likewise,
            it was also during his era that British Colonialist Conquered the
            area; and he was reported to have resisted the colonial conquest and
            subjugation of his authority to Fika rulership despite the power of
            the Colonialists. Therefore Saaban's Era can be regarded as a

            Mai Grema took the power and reigned between 1924 to 1945 CE. It was
            during his reign that the British Colonialist finally relocated the
            Fika Emirate's administrative headquarters from Fika Village to
            Potiskum town, and included Tikau in the new Fika Emirate. So too
            were other chieftaincies within the defunct Karai - Karai
            commonwealth. While relating the imposition of Fika Emirate's
            rulership over Tikau dynasty by British Colonial Masters, Sule 2014
            asserted that the later had consequently caused a lot of set back on
            Tikau dynasty. It was the period during which the area was relegated
            to the status of a village area, thereby lost kts sovereignty or
            entity. In consequence, Mai Grema became the first village head of
            Tikau village area with the headquarters at Tikau. As a good leader,
            he was able to mobilize his people to accomodate and endure the
            retrogressive development in the status of their domain. in 1945,
            Mai Grema died, and was succeeded by his son; "Mai Abubakar Shuwa
            Ibn Grema".
