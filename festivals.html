      <h3>The Collection of Zakkat and Waqaf</h3>
      <p>
        In case of the history of Zakat in Tikau Emirate, it can be traced back
        to the advent of Islam to the Emirate through Kanem Borno Empire; when
        the region had an organized political system which was governed based on
        Islamic system. During which Zakat was the major source of revenue to
        the Empire as well as an instrument of its fiscal and social policies.
        Therefore, the institution of Zakat existed in the area which is known
        today as Tikau Emirate long before the colonialism, through the records
        of zakat administration and distribution are not fully archived in the
        Emirate.
        <br />
        Zakat and Waqf are closely related; the fundamental difference between
        the two is that the former is mamdatory while the latter is voluntarily,
        but they are usually managed by the same institution. Tikau Emirate
        Zakat and Wagf committee came into being in 2002; as a result of the
        Executive directives by the first Civilian Governor of Yobe State Alhaji
        Bukar Abba Ibrahim, FNIQS, who directed all the fourteen Emirate
        Councils in the same state to establish a committee for Zakat and waqf
        in their various domains. In compliance with the said Executives
        Directives, His Royal Highness the Mai of Tikau, Alhaji Muhammadu
        Abubakar Ibn Grema constituted abd inaugurated a seven man high powered
        committee with him as the Grand Patron and Galadima of Tikau "Alhaji
        Sambo Sarki" as Chairman, together with six other prominent members from
        the Emirate to implement the collection and distributio of Zakat, and
        also to lanuch an annual Waqf collection in the Emmirate.

        <p class="waqf"> <b> Collection of Zakat and Waqf in Tikau Emirate</b></p>
        <p>
        One of the key Mandates of Tikau Emirate Zakat and Waqf committee is proper 
        collection of all sort of Zakatable wealth across the Emirate.
        In fulfilment of this mandate, the committee has developed two strategies for Zakat collection
        which are:
       </p> 
        <p class="waqf"><b> Organized Annual Collection</b></p>
        <p>
        This refers to the collection of annual Zakat of farm products, animals and other Zakatable 
        wealth from well-meaning individuals of the Emirate within a specified period. usually the 
        collection is conducted via the village heads across different part of the Emirate. At the centre 
        of the committee categorized and itemized whatever is collected before central distribution at the Emir's Palace.
        </p>
        <p class="waqf"><b>Open Ended Collection</b></p>
        <p>
        This also refers to the collection of Zakat of farm products, animals, and other Zakatable wealth from 
        well-meaning individuals of the Emirate at any given time, since Zakat has no specific due date. This can 
        be directly to the secretariat of the committee or via the village heads across the Emirate.
        incase of Waqf, the committee used to organize an annual launching for its collection, usually one of the 
        prominent and well to do sons of the Emirate is selected as a chief launcher for the year, to be supported 
        by some other personalities as co-launchers from within and outside the Emirate council.
        </p>
      <br>
      <p class="waqf"><b> Distribution of Zakat and Waqf in Tikau Emirate </b></p>
      <p>
       The committe has developed two ways of distributing Zakat of all sort. they are:
       </p>
       <p class="waqf2"><b> Annual Public Distribution of Zakat </b></p>
       <p>
       This refers to disbursing what has been collected as Zakat during the annual collection exercise to the 
       categories of eligible people as mentioned by Shari'ah annually; with the aim of encouraging people to give
       out Zakat. This disbursement comes few days after the annual collection exercise at Emir's palace.
       </p>
       <p class="waqf2"><b>Day to Day Distribution of Zakat </b></p>
       <p>
       This refers to concurrent disbursement of collected Zakat items to eligible people at inttermittent 
       intervals, usually on request as a result of critical social or health condtion. This disbursement has no limit of time and place.
       Usually, the committee verifies eligible people and provides them with what is available in Zakat fund either in cash or kind.
       </p>
       <br>
       <br>
       <p class="waqf"><b> Activities of Zakat and Waqf Committee in Tikau Emirate </b></p>
       <p>
       The Zakat and Waqf committee of Tikau Emirate has introduced many islamics programmes on which Waqf funds
       are channeled. This includes;

      <h3>The Tree Planning Campaign</h3>
      <p>

        <br />
        Tree planting is an important method for carbon sequestration, as trees
        absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Tree planting initiatives
        in Nigeria also aim to enhance biodiversity, restore degraded lands, and
        support rural livelihoods.On the 5th of June 2014, we took a bold step
        towards environmental conservation by launching a purposeful
        tree-planting project in Fika, a community in Yobe State, Northern
        Nigeria. This initiative, marking world environment day, was a
        collaboration with across Communities Initiative and aimed to plant over
        200 trees; an effort that seeks to green the community and raise
        awareness on the urgent need for environmental stewardship.This
        gathering was not just a tree-planting exercise; but proved to be a
        community-driven movement emphasizing the role of individual action in
        developing a sustainable future. Local community leaders, environmental
        advocates, and residents came together, unified by a shared overall
        mission: to combat desertification, promote sustainable development, and
        enhance biodiversity in the region. It is safe to say that several
        “plant moms and plant dads” were created that day!

      <h3>BARAKAU (CULTURAL DISPLAY)</h3>

        <br />
        Barakau is a Kare-Kare Cultural activity that marks the end of the year
        harvest, it is a festival activity during which relatives and friends
        are invited to share the merriment of the celebration. Barakau like many
        other Kare-Kare cultural activities were celebrated at the end of
        harvesting season. The celebration in merry making festival after
        harvest. But today Barakau occasion has been centralized at Degubi or
        Jalam town. It serves as a forum for showcasing the rich Kare-Kare
        cultural tradition, affairs and customs. Traditional Weapons and war
        equipment like shield, bow arrow, spears; Machetes, sword and the likes
        are also displayed. Characteristics of Barakau among Kare-Kare cultural
        activities remain the same in times of the celebration. Highlight of the
        occasion includes cultural dances and songs which consist among others
        Gumi, Shira, Shela, Algeta, Doga Yaro, Kanjau, Ganga, Shafara Lela, and
        many others.

      <br />
      <h3>SAWAKA (CULTURAL DISPLAY)</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Sawaku</b> is another Kare-Kare performance, which serve as starting
        pointfor eating newly harvested crops, nobody is allowed to eat from
        this new crops until the Head of Village starts. This festival usually
        takes place in November. The elder of the Ward Head (Bulama) will kill a
        he goat (male) and eat at the outskirts in western part of the village;
        they use a he goat because it is believe that a he goat is good in
        fetching the devils. And the reason why they took it to the outskirts
        because they believe that there is evil spirits. In the evening,
        horsemen were allowed to go to any body’s farm and pick crops they may
        use during the night free of charge. From that very time onward,
        everybody is allowed to eat the newly harvested crops.When Kare-Kare
        accepted Islam as religion, they follow the teachings of Islam in their
        various communities by replacing it with ZaKat for the new harvested
        crops. This festival is practice in the Kare-Kare communities by the
        non-Muslim. Islam always enjoys what is good and forbid what is evil.
        The activities of the festivals that contradicts Islam such as killing
        of he goat believing that is good for fetching the devils, restraining
        people from eating their newly crop until the Head of Village starts,
        found no more in the Kare-Kare community by the coverts.

      <h3>A DURBAR FESTIVAL </h3>
      <P>
        A Durbar Festival is also celebrated as an occasional festival in Tikau Emirate.
        This Festival usually marks an important event, such as Eid el Kabir, Eid el fitri 
        or a  visit by highly respected personality. During this festival, the Emir and his entourage
        parade on horses, accompanied by Musicians, and ending at the Emir's palace. Thus, it is considered
        tourist attraction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>KAMTI (CULTURAL DISPLAY)</h3>
      <p>
        Kamti is a Kare-Kare cultural activity that marks the end of the year
        harvest, it is a festival during which relatives and friends are invited
        to share the merriment of the celebration. Kamti like any other
        Kare-Kare cultural activities, it has originated from Gudi and it is
        celebrated at intervals of three (3) years that is after every three
        years Kamti is celebrated.The celebration usually took place in
        November. It is merry-marking festival celebrated immediately after
        harvest. But today Kamti is celebrated every year and on different
        Kare-Kare groups such as
        <b
          >Kare-Kare Gudi, Kare-Kare Damagum, Kare-Kare Maje, Kare-Kare Dagare,
          Kare-Kare Ningi, Kare-Kare Badawa, Kare-Kare Jufulum </b
        >etc.The mass migration from Gudi to new settlement resulted in making
        different Kare-Kare groups autonomous, especially to do with Kamti
        celebration. The Kare-Kare Maje and Jufulum celebrate Kamti every year
        instead of once in three (3) years, but Kare-Kare Ningi and Badawa,
        Dokto still keep to system of after three (3) years. Characteristic of
        Kamti remain the same inspite of difference in times of the celebration.
        Kare-Kare community of Juhulum were the first group to stand in October
        middle, it last for three days and on the last day goats were kill,<b>
          Mishi (local beer)</b
        >
        is served free for those who came to take. Group of dancers like
        <b>Amzara, Bare, Dudurotetira </b> etc are displayed.The most important
        thing to consider in this Kamti is that, there is usually a drum called
        <b>“Gulo”</b> when the Kamti time has come, they beat it on Friday
        night, the Gulo will not see the ends of next harvest, that is why it is
        beaten by an old man. There is also belief which is mystic in nature to
        the Kare-Kare people that on the last day of Kamti, when the traditional
        ruler celebrate his own, there must be rainfall on that day and this
        belief that, the rainfall is because of the celebration.With the
        acceptance of Islam by the Kare-Kare in their community, some
        traditional festival and belief mentioned above were found no more
        practice. Islam is a religion that changes the traditions that
        contradicts Islam by its converts. The traditions remains in the hands
        of Non-Muslims in the Kare-Kare communities.

      <h3>WA'OTO BOBANO (CULTURAL DISPLAY)</h3>
      <p>
        This is another festival or cultural activities performed by Kare-Kare
        during the cause of growing season, in August more especially the Ward
        Head (Bulama) declares a free day work for the cause of Wo’oto Bobano
        (special food cook day). In this day, some special food popularly known
        as <b>‘Uru ki Buma’ </b> was prepared in each and every house of the
        affected village, this is because the time of these festival also
        varies. These special food means a food that were not usually cooked
        unless occasionally. The Head of family together with his members will
        gather all the agricultural tools in the house, arranged them in a
        straight line and placed on each took a piece of Uru (food). He will
        then utter some prayers that all creatures killed by the farm
        cultivation might not be counted against them because they did not do it
        intentionally. By doing so, according to their traditional believes, the
        family became free from any harm done to any creature during the farming
        period. This was done inform of Zakat which Islam places. The festival
        or cultural activities performed by Kare-Kare in their community during
        the cause of growing season found no more practice by the converts
        except non-Muslims and more among Muslims.

      <h3>Salah Celebration</h3>
      <p>
        We have two types of Salah Celebration, which are:
        <b>Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr</b>
        Eid al-Adha is a festival celebrated by Muslims in Nigeria and all over
        the world on the 10th day of the Hijri month of Dhu al-Hijja. It is one
        of two official holidays celebrated in Islam. It honors the willingness
        of Prophet Ibrahim (A.S) to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael) as an act
        of obedience to Allah’s Command.It is referred to as
        <b> “Eid Al-Kabir”, or in Hausa Babbar Sallah </b>. Muslims in Nigeria
        including the Kare-Kare people celebrates it with worship that includes
        going to the prayer ground in the morning, slaughtering sacrifices
        mostly in the form of male sheep i.e. ram (a core activity of the day),
        and sharing meals with family and friends. The aim is to share happiness
        with other Muslims and, in some cases, non-Muslim neighbors.Males and
        Females of all ages visit the prayer ground to perform the Eid prayer.
        Most of them wears new clothes to show joy and happiness, as this is one
        of the year’s most important days. They perform this prayer by observing
        two Rakah’s after the Imam and then staying on the prayer ground to
        listen to the sermon from the imam, also attended by kings and other
        dignitaries. A gun is fired into the sky from the royal entourage to
        mark the end of the prayer.After completing the prayer and the sermon,
        the imam slaughters his sacrifice, often a male sheep. This sheep is
        present at the prayer round before the prayer begins. After the
        slaughtering, the Muslims return to their homes to slaughter theirs in
        order to draw closer to God and celebrate. Most Muslims slaughter sheep,
        which are very expensive in this season. A few of the affluent slaughter
        cows and camels.After the Eid al-Adha prayer ends, the Emirs and chiefs
        in Kare-Kare, Northern Nigeria in general come out as the head of the
        crowd of worshippers and others watching the proceeding, riding adorned
        horses. It is also known as the Durbar Festival. A horse race follows in
        front of the emir.<b> Eid al-Fitr </b> marks the end of Ramadan, the
        Islamic holy month of fasting. Eid-al-Fitr typically falls on the first
        day of the month of Shawwal in the Islamic Calendar. The celebration
        lasts for one to three days.
